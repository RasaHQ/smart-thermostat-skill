Q: What are Hive door and window sensors used for?
A: They detect when doors or windows are opened or closed. Common uses include security alerts, turning off heating when a window is open, triggering lights when you arrive home, or turning off smart plugs when you leave.

Q: How do I install a door/window sensor?
A: The sensor comes in two parts - attach the larger part to the door frame and the smaller magnet to the door itself. They should be within 10mm of each other when the door is closed.

Q: Can I get alerts when a door is left open too long?
A: Yes, create an action in the app to send a notification if a door has been open for longer than a set time - useful for checking if someone left the back door open.

Q: The sensor shows the door as open when it's closed, how do I fix this?
A: Check the alignment of the two sensor parts - they may have shifted. The magnet needs to be very close to the sensor when the door is closed. Reattach if necessary.

Q: Can I use door sensors for home security?
A: Yes, you can set up notifications to alert you whenever a door or window opens while you're away. The app also keeps a history of when doors were opened and closed.

Q: What automations can I create with door sensors?
A: Popular automations include: turning on hallway lights when the front door opens, switching off smart plugs when you leave the house, or pausing your heating schedule when a window is opened.

Q: Do door sensors require batteries?
A: Yes, door and window sensors are battery-powered. The batteries typically last 2-3 years, and the app will notify you when they need replacing.

Q: Do door sensors work with voice assistants?
A: Door sensors can't be directly controlled by voice, but they can trigger automations that affect other devices you can control by voice.
