Q: What temperature should I set my thermostat to save energy?
A: The Energy Saving Trust recommends 18-21°C for most households. Reducing your thermostat by just 1°C can cut your heating bill by up to 10%.

Q: Does turning the heating on and off use more energy than leaving it on low?
A: It's generally more efficient to use your thermostat and schedule to heat your home only when needed, rather than leaving heating on constantly at a low temperature.

Q: How can I see how much energy my heating is using?
A: The Hive app includes usage reports that show your heating patterns over time. You can view daily, weekly, and monthly summaries to understand your energy consumption.

Q: Will using the boost feature use a lot of energy?
A: Boost temporarily increases your heating for a set period (1-6 hours). It's fine for occasional use, but if you're using it regularly, consider adjusting your schedule instead.

Q: Can smart plugs help me save energy?
A: Yes, Hive smart plugs with energy monitoring show you exactly which appliances are using the most power. You can also schedule them to turn off automatically, preventing standby energy waste.

Q: How can I avoid heating an empty house?
A: Use scheduling to match your heating to when you're home. You can also use motion sensors to detect when rooms are empty and create automations to adjust heating accordingly.

Q: What is the most energy-efficient way to heat my home?
A: Use scheduling rather than manual control, set appropriate temperatures (not too high), use Frost Protect when away for extended periods, and consider smart radiator valves to heat only the rooms you're using.

Q: Can I track my energy savings over time?
A: Yes, the Hive app shows your heating usage history so you can compare different periods and see the impact of any changes you've made to your schedule or habits.
