Q: What does the Hive hub do?
A: The hub is the brain of your Hive system - it connects to your router via ethernet and communicates with all your Hive devices using wireless signals. Without it, your devices won't work with the app.

Q: What do the lights on my Hive hub mean?
A: Solid green means everything is working normally. Fast flashing green means it's trying to connect to the internet. Slow flashing green means a firmware update is in progress (can take up to an hour). Alternating red/amber means it's trying to recover from a connection failure. Solid green with flashing amber means it's ready to pair with a new device.

Q: Where should I place my Hive hub?
A: Place it in an open space, at least one metre from the ground. Avoid putting it in cupboards, enclosed spaces, or near large metal objects as this blocks signals. Keep it away from TVs, hi-fi systems, cordless phones, baby monitors, and games consoles to avoid interference.

Q: My hub light is flashing red or amber, what should I do?
A: This means the hub is trying to recover from a connection issue. Leave it for 20 minutes to see if it recovers. If not, check your ethernet cable is properly connected to your router (not a Wi-Fi extender), verify your broadband is working, and try power cycling the hub by unplugging it for 30 seconds.

Q: How do I reset my Hive hub?
A: Press and hold the reset button on the bottom of the hub for more than 10 seconds, then release. The light should spin blue. Follow the app instructions to complete reinstallation.

Q: Can I move my Hive hub to a different location?
A: Yes, as long as it stays connected to your router via ethernet cable. Moving it closer to your devices can improve signal if you're having connectivity issues.

Q: Do I need a Hive hub for every device?
A: No, one hub supports your entire Hive system. A single hub can typically handle 30+ devices depending on your home layout.

Q: Is the hub compatible with all routers?
A: The hub requires an ethernet connection and is NOT compatible with 2.5Gbps ports - make sure you're connecting to a standard ethernet port on your router.

Q: What happens if my hub goes offline?
A: You won't be able to control devices via the app, but you can still use physical controls on your thermostat. For heating emergencies, you can press the override button on your Hive boiler receiver.

Q: Can I use a USB-C cable to power my hub?
A: Yes, if you're having power issues, you can try an alternative USB-C cable to rule out a faulty power cable.
