Q: What do Hive motion sensors do?
A: Motion sensors detect movement in a room and can trigger actions - like turning on lights, adjusting heating via smart radiator valves, or sending you a notification when you're away.

Q: How do I set up my Hive motion sensor?
A: In the Hive app, tap the menu icon, then Install Devices. Select Other Hive Devices, pull the battery tab from the sensor, and tap Start. The LED will flash amber while searching for your hub. Once it appears in the app, name it and tap Save.

Q: Where should I position my motion sensor?
A: Install it 2-3 metres above the floor to avoid blind spots. Avoid pointing it at heat sources like radiators or air conditioners, and keep it away from drafty windows. The sensor detects motion up to 5 metres away with a 94-120° field of view.

Q: Do I need to mount the motion sensor on a wall?
A: No, you can simply place it on a table, shelf, or door ledge if you prefer. Wall mounting is optional.

Q: How do I set up automations with my motion sensor?
A: In the Hive app, go to Actions and create a new action. Select your motion sensor as the trigger and choose what happens - for example, turn on specific lights, set brightness levels, and automatically turn off after a set time.

Q: Can one motion sensor trigger multiple lights?
A: Yes, your sensor can trigger multiple lights or even entire light groups with a single action.

Q: My motion sensor keeps triggering falsely, what can I do?
A: Reposition the sensor away from heat sources, windows, or areas where pets move around. If you have pets, enable the pet-friendly option in settings to reduce unnecessary alerts.

Q: How do I reset my motion sensor?
A: Slide the front case upwards and press the red button for 10 seconds. The LED will turn red then off, then flash green once. After 5 seconds it will flash amber, ready for pairing.

Q: Can I turn off my motion sensor temporarily?
A: There's no button or app setting to disable it. The workaround is to slide open the case and remove the battery.

Q: How long do motion sensor batteries last?
A: Typically 2-3 years with normal use. The app will notify you when the battery is running low.

Q: Do motion sensors require a subscription?
A: No, Hive motion sensors work without any subscription.

Q: Can I use voice control with motion sensors?
A: No, motion sensors cannot be controlled via Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or other voice assistants - they only act as triggers for automations.
