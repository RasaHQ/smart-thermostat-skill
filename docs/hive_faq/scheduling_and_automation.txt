Q: How do I set up a heating schedule?
A: Open the Hive app, tap on your thermostat, then select Schedule. You can create up to six time slots per day with different temperature settings for each.

Q: Can I set different temperatures for weekdays and weekends?
A: Yes, the scheduling feature allows you to create completely different schedules for each day of the week, so you can have a lie-in schedule for weekends.

Q: What happens if I manually change the temperature when a schedule is active?
A: Manual adjustments will override the schedule until the next scheduled change. You can also set how long the manual override lasts in the app settings.

Q: How do I turn off my heating when I go on holiday?
A: Use Frost Protect mode in the app, which keeps your home at a minimum safe temperature (usually 7°C) to prevent pipes freezing while using minimal energy.

Q: What are the thermostat modes?
A: Schedule runs your heating according to your programmed times. Manual maintains a constant temperature you set. Boost increases heating for a set time (1-6 hours). Off puts heating in Frost Protection mode.

Q: How do I use the Boost feature on my thermostat?
A: Press the heating button on top of the thermostat to turn on boost. Press again to increase the duration. Turn the dial to change the boost temperature (default is 22°C). Press the back button to cancel early.

Q: What are Hive Actions?
A: Actions are automations that link your Hive devices together. For example, you can set lights to turn on automatically when a motion sensor detects movement, or turn off a smart plug when a door sensor shows you've left.

Q: How do I create an automation?
A: In the app, tap Actions and create a new action. Choose a trigger (like motion detected or door opened), set conditions (like time of day), and select what should happen (turn on lights, adjust heating, etc.).

Q: Can I set lights to come on automatically at sunset?
A: Yes, you can schedule lights to turn on at sunset and off at bedtime. The app adjusts automatically for seasonal changes in daylight hours.
